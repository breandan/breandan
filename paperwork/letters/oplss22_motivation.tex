        \opening{Dear OPLSS Organizers and Admissions Committee Members,}
        As a Ph.D. student in the School of Computer Science at McGill University researching the intersection of machine learning and programming languages, I am particularly interested in language design, type-safe program synthesis, computer-aided reasoning, and representation learning on source code.

        I am writing to express my interest in attending OPLSS \textsc{\char13}22. By attending your summer school, I hope to build a more principled theoretical foundation for my research, which draws inspiration from algebra, type-theory, and formal methods. I believe that PL theory offers a bridge to compositional generalization that current methods lack and will be crucial to achieving of our research goals.

        As a previous OPLSS (\textsc{\char13}19, \textsc{\char13}21) participant, I have been fortunate to apply the ideas I have learnt at your school to great effect in my research on code completion. Although I am deeply passionate about programming languages, as my primary research area is software engineering, I would need to finance my trip out-of-pocket, for which the fellowship I am applying would help to defray.

        Thank you for carefully considering my application.

        \closing{Sincerely,\\
