    \opening{Dear OPLSS Organizers and Admissions Committee Members,}
    I am writing to express my interest in attending the OPLSS \textsc{\char13}21 program. As a second-year Ph.D. student at McGill University who is working on computer-aided programming and languages for learning and inference, I would greatly value an opportunity to participate in the program your school has organized.

    Developing more reliable and user-friendly programming tools is the primary focus of my research, which studies the application of automatic and inductive programming to software engineering. I am especially interested in attending the lectures on message-passing, Kleene algebras and probabilistic computation.

    As a previous  OPLSS (\textsc{\char13}19) participant, my research has directly benefited from the lessons your school instills, drawing inspiration from type theory and mechanized reasoning to inform the design and implementation of programming tools. I would be honored if you would consider my application to reattend this year.
    \closing{Sincerely,\\
