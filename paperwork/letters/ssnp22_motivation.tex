        \opening{Dear Organizers for the Summer School on Neurosymbolic Programming,}
        As a Ph.D. student at Mila/IQIA conducting research at the intersection of programming languages and neural-symbolic systems, I would highly value the opportunity to attend your summer school. In particular, my research applies techniques from type theory to help programmers design safer and more efficient differentiable programs using dependent types, characterize the expressivity and robustness of neural language models via program transformations, as well as apply neural-symbolic systems to detect and correct errors in classical programs via constraint satisfaction and sketch-based program synthesis.

        As the lead organizer of the 2021 NeurIPS workshop on Advances in Programming Languages Neurosymbolic Systems and the ML4Code@MTL Group, I have actively worked to promote research in neural-symbolism and am familiar with the work of many of the speakers in your program. I am confident that I would be able to contribute to the discussions at the summer school and would benefit greatly from the opportunity to interact with your participants. By attending, I hope to stay informed of recent advances in probabilistic programming and gain a better understanding of the reasoning capabilities of neurosymbolic systems for tasks like theorem proving and program verification.

        I am forwarding a copy of my CV by email, and look forward to hearing from you. Thank you for carefully considering my application!
