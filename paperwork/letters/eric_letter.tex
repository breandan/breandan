  \opening{Dear Prof. Blanchette, Prof. Pientka and distinguished members of the faculty,}
  \vspace{12pt}

  As a Ph.D. student at McGill and Mila/IQIA conducting research on programming languages and neural-symbolic systems, I have been following the search for a tenure-track professor at the School of Computer Science. This Spring, at the request of my colleague Avinash Bhat, I interviewed Eric Atkinson for the position formerly held by Prof. Si, whom I recommended three years ago.

  I am hereby writing to express my support for Eric's candidacy. Over the last two years, I have interacted with Eric at various conferences and have been impressed by his depth of knowledge and practical approach to probabilistic programming, an interest we both share, and I believe complements McGill's well-known research strengths in programming languages and machine learning.

  Common research interests aside, I believe Eric's open-minded enthusiasm and talent for communicating complex ideas clearly are plain to see, and would be a valuable asset to the School of Computer Science. Although your department has ample shoes to fill with Prof. Si's departure, I am confident that Eric is more than qualified for the role and I am happy to recommend him for it.
