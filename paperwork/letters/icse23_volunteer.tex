\textbf{Subject: ICSE 2023 Volunteering Reference for Breandan Considine}}
  \opening{Dear ICSE Student Volunteer Selection Committee,}
  This letter is to recommend Breandan Considine, a Ph.D. student under my joint supervision, as a volunteer for ICSE'23. Breandan has a conditionally accepted paper at the BotSE'23 workshop, and he has experience volunteering for many conferences and workshops, including the AIPLANS Workshop at NeurIPS 2021, PLDI 2022, SPLASH 2022, POPL (2022, 2023), and ICSE (2019, 2022).

  Breandan has a strong background in software engineering and an interest in applying machine learning to software engineering problems. By attending, he hopes to gain a better understanding of the latest advances in formal methods for software engineering, which are a focus of our research group. I am confident that with his skills and background, Breandan would be an asset to the ICSE conference and am happy to recommend him as a volunteer without reservation.

  Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or concerns.
