        \opening{To whom it may concern,\\}
        As a Ph.D. student at McGill University, I am currently employed as a teaching assistant for \textit{COMP 597: Automated Reasoning with Machine Learning}, and have taught several other graduate courses in machine learning over the last three years. I am writing on behalf of Ms. Rebecca Wang, a student in that class with whom I have interacted on several occasions over the last few months.

        As an undergraduate student, Rebecca punches above her weight in a mostly graduate-level seminar. She asks thoughtful questions, regularly appears at office hours, and I have observed her helping other students with their assignments. While I have known Rebecca only briefly, during that time, I have been impressed by her unflinching inquisitiveness and willingness to help others.

        Although we need more students like Rebecca in our field, I believe the same skills required to excel in computer science would also be valuable in the legal profession and am confident those qualities, which Rebecca possesses in ample measure, will serve her well in whatever occupation she chooses to pursue. I am therefor happy to recommend her to your degree program without reservation.\\
