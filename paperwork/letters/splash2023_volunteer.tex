        \opening{Dear SPLASH Volunteering Organizers,}
        Four years ago, I had the chance to visit Cascais, where I first discovered my love for programming languages research. At that time, I was a self-impressed Masterâ€™s student presenting his first contribution to differentiable programming. It was there I first learned about lattices and abstract interpretation, which have continued to fascinate me ever since. Since then, I have embarked on a Ph.D., made a small breakthrough on program repair, and attended many inspiring conferences. But none of these had the same impact as that one week in 2019.

        The last four years have taught me a great deal about humility, perseverance and programming language theory. The more I learn about these topics, the more I realize how deep they go and how little I really know about them. Besides the shame of ignorance, what remains is a burning curiosity - and wherever that leads, I know I must follow. There is still so much more I crave to know, so many questions I have to ask! By attending SPLASH, I will have the chance to return to where it all began, and bring closure to many unanswered questions.

        There was once a person who taught me about type theory. I miss her, but have come to appreciate there is more to programming than just types. Programming is about communicating human values -- not describing the world as it is or could be -- but how it \textit{ought to be}. In the coming AI era, we will need better ways to share our dreams and designs with soulless machines. This is a lesson, I believe, the SPLASH community also realizes. The easier programming is, and the more humans who can program computers, the better our collective future will be.

        Thank you for carefully considering my application.

        \closing{Sincerely,\\
