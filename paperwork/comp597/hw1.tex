    \noindent This is the first assignment of the McGill School of Computer Science course, COMP 597: Automated Reasoning with ML. Please show all your work.

    \section{Problem 1: SAT Encoding}

    \noindent Answer one of the following two problems using a SAT solver:\\

    \noindent 1. A prime palindrome is a natural number that has exactly two factors and whose string representation is the same read forwards and backwards. Give any 100-digit binary prime palindrome, and the code used to find it.\\

    \noindent 2. Every alphanumeric character in the following ciphertext maps to an English letter. Every word belongs to the English 10k dictionary.\\

    \noindent Provide a valid plaintext satisfying the above criteria, the key, and the source code used to decode it using a SAT solver of your choice.

    \pagebreak\section{Problem 2: DIY SAT Solving}

    \noindent Choose one of the following two options, write about it, and submit your source code. Give instructions for how to run it and a few test cases.

    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Implement your own solver. Either DPLL, UP or two-watched literals.
    \item Hack into MiniSat/Kissat. Make improvement. Report your findings.
    \end{enumerate}

    \section {Problem 3: Uninterpreted function equivalence}
    \noindent Implement an uninterpreted function solver and test it on the following questions:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item a * (b + c + d) \overset{?}{=} a * b + a * c + a * d
        \item \ldots
    \end{enumerate}
