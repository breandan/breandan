    \section{SAT Encoding}

    The following solutions can be obtained using a solver of your choice. Please show all work. Only solutions obtained with a SAT solver will receive credit.\\

    \noindent \textbf{Palindromic primes} (20 points): A prime palindrome is a natural number with exactly two factors which are the same written forwards or backwards. Let $1802201963_{10} = PQR$. What are its factors in base-2? What is the largest $M=PQR$ whose factors are all distinct binary palindromes you can find in an hour? Please describe your solution and its SAT encoding.\\

    \noindent \textbf{Bonus question} (10 points): Every alphanumeric character in the following ciphertext maps to a single case-insensitive letter in the English alphabet. Every plaintext word can be found in the English 10k dictionary.\footnote{\url{https://github.com/first20hours/google-10000-english/blob/master/google-10000-english.txt}}\\

    \noindent What is the plaintext and who originally wrote this? Please describe how you solved it, provide the key and SAT encoding in a language of your choice.

    \pagebreak\section{Problem 2: DIY SAT Solving}

    \noindent \textbf{Programming exercise} (40 points): Please select one of the following two options, write a short report, and submit your source code. Please provide instructions for how reproduce your findings and a few test cases.

    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Write a SAT solver from scratch by implementing an existing algorithm such as DPLL, unit propagation or two-watched literals, describe your implementation and evaluate it on a few toy SAT problems.
    \item Make a substantive improvement to a competitive SAT solver (e.g. Kissat~\footnote{\url{http://fmv.jku.at/kissat/}} or MiniSat~\footnote{\url{http://minisat.se/}}) which measurably increases performance on a standard benchmark~\footnote{\url{https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~hoos/SATLIB/benchm.html}}, and document your approach and findings.
    \end{enumerate}

    \section {Problem 3: Uninterpreted function equivalence}

    \noindent \textbf{SMT exercise} (40 points): Encode the following problems as SMT instances and report your answers. Please show all work:\\

    \begin{enumerate}
    \item For what values of $w, x, y, z \in \mathbb{Z}$ does $w = x^3+y^3+z^3$ hold?
    \item For what values of $w, x, y, z \in \mathbb{N}$ does $w^3 + x^3 = y^3+z^3$ hold?
    \item A nonnegative matrix is called doubly-stochastic if its rows and columns all sum to the same number. Find three distinct matrices $a, b, c: \mathbb{Z}_3^{3\times 3}$ such that $a, b, c$ are doubly stochastic.
    \end{enumerate}
